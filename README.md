# network-scanner
A Python-based network scanner that performs a ping sweep to find active hosts and scans specified ports for open connections. Supports IP ranges, single IPs, and hostnames. Features multi-threaded port scanning with user-defined delays and defaults to common ports if none are specified. Includes service name retrieval for open ports.
